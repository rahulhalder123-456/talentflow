## ðŸ”´ ACTION REQUIRED: Configure API Keys & Security Rules

This app will not run correctly until you perform these **required manual steps**.

### 1. Configure API Keys & Credentials

- In the root of your project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
- Open your new `.env.local` file and add the following lines, pasting your keys after the `=`.
- Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate a free **Google AI API key**.
- Go to your [Firebase Project Settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/) to find your web app's **Firebase credentials**.
- Go to your [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/app/keys) to generate API keys.

```
# Google AI API Key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_KEY_HERE

# Firebase Credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...

# Razorpay API Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET
```

### 2. Update Firestore Security Rules

This is a **critical one-time setup** to make your app work correctly.

1.  **Go to Firestore Rules**: In the Firebase Console, go to the Firestore Database section and click the **Rules** tab.
2.  **Copy & Paste**: A file named `firestore.rules` exists in your project's root directory. Open this file, copy its **entire contents**, and paste them into the editor in the Firebase Console, replacing any existing rules.
3.  **Publish**: Click the **Publish** button.

### 3. Set Up Your First Admin User (CRITICAL)

To use the admin features, you must manually grant admin rights to your own user account. **This is a required, one-time setup step.**

1.  **Get Your User ID (UID):**
    *   Sign up or sign in to your application.
    *   Go to the [Firebase Authentication users page](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/authentication/users).
    *   Find your account in the list and copy the value from the **User UID** column.

2.  **Create the Admin Document in Firestore:**
    *   Go to the [Firestore Database data page](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/firestore/data).
    *   Click **+ Start collection**.
    *   For **Collection ID**, enter `config`.
    *   Click **Next**.
    *   For **Document ID**, enter `admins`.
    *   Under **Fields**, add the following field:
        *   Field name: `uids`
        *   Field type: `array`
        *   Field value: Click **Add value**, paste your **User UID** from step 1, and click **Add**.
    *   Click **Save**.

Your app will now recognize you as an admin. You can grant admin rights to other users from the "Manage Users" page within the app's admin dashboard.

### 4. Deploying to Vercel?

When you deploy your project to a hosting provider like Vercel, you must configure your environment variables there as well.

1.  **Go to Project Settings:** In your Vercel project, go to the **Settings** tab.
2.  **Go to Environment Variables:** Select **Environment Variables** from the side menu.
3.  **Add Your Keys:** Copy each key-value pair from your `.env.local` file and add them to Vercel.
4.  **Redeploy:** After adding the variables, you **must trigger a new deployment** for the changes to take effect. Go to the "Deployments" tab and redeploy your latest commit.
